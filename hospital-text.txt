You are in the hospital lobby, with the reception desk on your right. You can sit down in the chairs next to reception, in the waiting room, in the outdoor courtyard, or in the cafe. The only exit to the road is through the main entrance in the lobby. Appointment rooms, rooms 1 to 20, can be found on the second floor. The lift is through the blue door and to the left, you can use it to get to the other floors. The cafe is also through the blue doors, but you continue straight through a second set of blue doors. This second set of doors will be unlocked between 7am and 9pm, which are the cafe opening hours. You can have either a Continental or English breakfast between 7am and 11am. Lunch is served between 11am and 4pm, and you can choose the beef broth, a gammon sandwich, a bean salad, or a cheese board with local olives and bread. For dinner, from 4pm until the cafe closes, there are several options. As a starter, you can have a mushroom soup in a bread bowl, a meat sharing platter, or prawn cocktail. Lasagne, steak and chips, a vegan burger, or pizza can be chosen as a main course. And for dessert, there is a panna cotta or cake of the day. You can order soda, coffee (latte, cappuccino, americano, flat white, or espresso), tea (berry, peppermint, green, or Earl Grey), hot chocolate, beer, and red or white wine if you are over 18. Both patients and visitors are welcome in the cafe, and everywhere in the hospital is wheelchair accessible. The toilets are opposite the lift, and they are all private gender-neutral stalls. Please remember to wash your hands as this is a hospital, so hygiene is key. For health reasons, the cafe takes card payments only, and a mask is recommended indoors. It is not mandatory any more, however. If you want to smoke, or just get some fresh air during your visit, there is an outdoor courtyard. The courtyard is through the red doors, passed the coffee machine, and through the glass doors. The cafe is the only place to eat in the hospital, but you can find hot drinks at the coffee machine or in the cafe. Note, the coffee machine does not contain milk, so only provides americanos and espressos. Water can be found at the water cooler in the waiting room. You will have your appointment with Dr Smith today. His office is room 17. Your appointment will be on time, and it will start with a short interview. You will then have a lumbar puncture, so you will be given a local anaesthetic and an aspirin. You will discuss the next steps with your doctor afterwards, and this whole process should take around 2 hours. The waiting room is next to the appointment rooms on the second floor. You are welcome to wait there and drink water, eat something in the cafe, or head straight home if you prefer. As you will be given an aspirin, you cannot drive due to drowsiness. Your companion can of course drive you home. If you did not bring your car, you can request a taxi at reception, or get the bus. The bus number 14 brings people directly from the road at the main entrance to the city centre. It leaves at 20 past every hour, since visitors are welcome any time. It is currently 11:40am and your appointment is at 2:30pm. We hope that you have a pleasant day at the hospital.
